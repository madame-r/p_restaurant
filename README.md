## Tips

If you import my sql file 'restaurant' located in the 00_readme folder

- You can go to yourlocalhost/login
- And use admin@admin.com / adminadmin
- Create menu informations in this order : new menu category, new menu item




## Code tricks

In the Online Order template, I couldn't display the property 'stock_quantity' by calling it directly. This didn't work :


```html
<p>Stock : {{ one_item.stock_quantity }} </p>

```


If you encounter the same kind of issue, try to replace the property by its function instead.

```html
<p>Stock : {{ one_item.getStockQuantity() }} </p>

```


## Future Improvements

- Menu Filters
- Order Online Management
- User Account
